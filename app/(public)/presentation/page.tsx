  "The dangerous part is the gap between visits.",
  "Miruwa monitors that gap. It combines daily Cantonese check-ins, wearable or vital-sign data, and deterministic escalation rules into a nurse dashboard.",
  "It is not an AI doctor. It does not diagnose or prescribe. It flags monitoring risks for nurse or clinician review.",
  "In our demo, Mrs. Chan is a 78-year-old heart-failure and hypertension patient. She reports shortness of breath and swelling, her weight has increased by more than 2 kg in three days, and she missed medication.",
  "Miruwa matches explainable rules, creates an alert, and moves her into the nurse review queue.",
  "The nurse can acknowledge the alert, notify family, and generate a weekly clinician summary. The platform also exports a PDF and a FHIR-style JSON bundle, so the information can fit into clinical workflows.",
  "Our first buyers would be elderly-care operators, care agencies, private clinics, insurers, and NGOs managing chronic-care populations.",

  "This is the nurse dashboard. It shows elderly patients, their latest check-in, risk state, and the top reason for review.",
  "Mrs. Chan is flagged because her recent monitoring data suggests possible deterioration.",
  "The product is not waiting for one dramatic emergency event. It combines small signals over time: weight, symptoms, medication adherence, and activity.",
  "Now Mrs. Chan reports shortness of breath and swelling, and her weight has increased by more than 2 kg in three days.",
  "Miruwa does not ask an LLM to decide severity. The rule engine matched HF-001 and HF-002, so the case is escalated for nurse review.",
  "The alert enters the nurse queue with the matched rules, evidence, and suggested operational action.",
  "The family gets a plain-language alert. It does not recommend treatment; it tells them what changed and that nurse review is recommended.",
  "At the end of the week, Miruwa generates a clinician-ready summary and exports a FHIR-style bundle. This is designed to fit into healthcare workflows, not become another isolated app.",

  },
  {
    q: "What is real?",
    a: "The dashboard, check-in simulation, rule engine, alert queue, summary generation, PDF export, and FHIR-style export are real. Hospital/eHealth integration is mocked.",

    q: "Who pays?",
    a: "Initial buyers are care agencies, elderly-care operators, private clinics, NGOs, and insurers managing chronic-care populations.",
  },
  {
    q: "What breaks at scale?",
    a: "False alarms, incomplete data, device fragmentation, and clinical liability. We handle this with conservative thresholds, data completeness scoring, human-in-the-loop nurse review, audit logs, and no diagnosis or treatment recommendations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why Hong Kong?",
    a: "Hong Kong has strong ageing and chronic-disease pressure, and its health system is moving toward stronger primary-care and eHealth infrastructure. Miruwa fits that direction by turning between-visit monitoring into a workflow.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why not just a phone call?",
    a: "Phone calls are unstructured and easy to miss. Miruwa turns check-ins into structured monitoring data, matched rules, nurse tasks, caregiver alerts, and clinician-ready summaries.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is this AI?",
    a: "AI is used where it is safe: summarising monitoring data and rewriting it for caregivers and clinicians. The actual risk logic is deterministic and auditable.",
