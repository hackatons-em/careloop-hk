// CareLoop HK — Deterministic Risk Engine (CORE)
//
// This is the heart of CareLoop. Risk severity is decided HERE by explicit,
// auditable rules — never by an LLM. AI is used elsewhere only to reword the
// summary for humans. Every matched rule carries the data evidence that fired
// it, so a nurse can see exactly why a patient was flagged.
//
// Rules (from the build spec):
//   HF-001  weight ↑ ≥ 2 kg over 3 days                      → review_today
//   HF-002  weight gain (≥1.5 kg/3d) + SOB + swelling         → escalate
//   MED-001 medication missed 2 days in a row                 → review_today
//   BP-001  systolic > 180 OR diastolic > 110                 → escalate
//   ACT-001 steps > 40% below baseline for 3 days             → watch
//
// Windows are CALENDAR-DATE aware (not array-index based) and thresholds compare
// the true value (rounding is only for the human-readable evidence string), so
// the rules behave correctly on sparse, gapped, or imported data.
